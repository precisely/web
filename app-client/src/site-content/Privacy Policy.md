## Privacy Policy

The data you generate, aggregate, track and compile with our service belong to you. We are providing a platform that enables these activities but we respect your ownership of your data, and will at no time expose, forward, share or sell your data with outside parties without your explicit consent. Conversely, we intend to provide mechanisms that simplify your ability to share your data at your choosing. You can download all of your data and/or delete your account at any time. If you wish to delete your account, please email a request to: [content@precise.ly](mailto:content@precise.ly). We plan to construct multiple levels of privacy such that you can opt for, and navigate between, four profile settings:

1) fully open sharing, with user name revealed (you set your username), 
2) sharing only with specific groups and individuals
you choose, 
3) anonymous sharing (no username exposed) with the public or with specific groups and individuals, and 
4) full privacy, no sharing. We suspect different users will want these levels of differential privacy depending on the
topic or data. While we're not an entity subject to HIPAA, we plan to build privacy infrastructure that meets or exceeds
these federal guidelines.

At the moment however, we are simply going to allow for full privacy and optional public sharing of data. We will update this Privacy Policy as we complete our research on the best way to implement open sharing, and we are happy to provide recommendations on the best ways for you to make your data open in the interim. This Privacy Policy applies to Web sites and services that are operated by precise.ly, Inc. ("The Company"). precise.ly, Inc. is not responsible or liable for the content or the privacy policies of sites to which it may link.
