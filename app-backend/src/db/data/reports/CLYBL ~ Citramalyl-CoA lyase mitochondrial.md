# What does the CLYBL gene do?

[CLYBL](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8N0X4) creates an energy production enzyme involved in the metabolism of vitamin B12 . It also involved in removing metals like magnesium and the citric acid cycle, which controls energy production and biosynthesis. Vitamin B12 is required for red blood cell formation, protein metabolism, neurological function, homocysteine conversion, and replicating DNA. Vitamin B12 plays a fundamental role in [detoxification](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19409980) due to its substantial [antioxidant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19799418) properties. Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked with [anemia, neurodegenerative disorder, cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367966), and [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069). This gene is located on chromosome 13.

# What are some common variants of CLYBL?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect mitochondrial enzyme function. There is one common variant in CLYBL: [C775T (Arg259Ter)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069).

<# C775T #>

  <Variant hgvs="NC_000013.10:g.100518634C>T" name="C775T"> 

    Instead of cytosine (C), there is a thymine (T) nucleotide.

                  } > 

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have one copy of the [C775T (Arg259Ter)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    This variant [shortens the protein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367966), which may lead to [malabsorption of B12 and mental fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009) due to improper binding between the protein and ions (electrically charged particles) or metals. People with this variant have blood serum vitamin B12 levels [88.9% lower](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367966) than normal and may have higher homocysteine levels. 

    This variant is also more common in people with [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069). In ME/CFS, [hypomethylation](http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2155-9899.1000228), or reduced gene expression and protein expression, is seen in a majority of certain [immune cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25111603/). Hypomethylation is greatly affected by the vitamins B12 and folate (B9), suggesting a blockage of B12 across the blood brain barrier. The reduction of circulating vitamin B12 also causes increased levels of [itaconate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29056341), an anti-microbial and immune regulating metabolic compound, which in turn deactivates vitamin B12. 

    # What should I do about this?

    - Check blood serum vitamin B12 levels. If too low, consider an [oral or injectable B12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009) supplement if low. 
    - Be cautious when taking [opioids, duloxetine, pregabalin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009), and [metformin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20488910?dopt=Abstract), which lower B12 levels.

People with this variant have blood serum vitamin B12 levels [36.2% lower](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367966) than normal. Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to [anemia, loss of balance, numbness or tingling in the arms and legs, and weakness](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002403.htm). Low levels of B12 may also cause increased levels of homocysteine, increasing the chance of [coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hardening of the arteries](https://labtestsonline.org/tests/homocysteine), and [mental fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009).

    This variant is much more common in people with [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069). In ME/CFS, [hypomethylation](http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2155-9899.1000228), or reduced gene expression and protein expression, is seen in a majority of certain [immune cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25111603/).

    # What should I do about this?

    - Consider a daily [oral folic acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009) supplement combined with oral or injectable B12. 
    - Avoid [opioids, duloxetine, pregabalin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009), [metformin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20488910?dopt=Abstract), and other anti-epilectic drugs. 
    - Check homocysteine levels. If elevated, consider taking [folate](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1017.html). 
    - If [homocysteine is elevated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18709886), watch for eye lens dislocations, “Marfan type” body shape, stroke, blood clotting issues, and low thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism).
