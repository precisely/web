<# Gene_Name CHRNA3 / #>

<# GeneName_full Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3 / #>

# What does the CHRNA3 gene do?

CHRNA3 encodes a neurotransmitter called [acetylcholine](http://www.uniprot.org/citations/8906617) that regulates the creation and destruction of nicotine receptors in the nervous system. It also controls [serotonin](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0022850) channels in the brain. Variants in this gene have been associated with [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290489), [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19836008), [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683) (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), [cocaine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20485328), and [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). This gene is located on chromosome 15.

# What are some common variants of CHRNA3?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect protein function. There are two common variants in CHRNA3: [C78606381T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=12914385) and [C645T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17503/).

    People with this variant have one copy of the [C78606381T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=12914385) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?
    
    The CHRNA3 protein plays a role in developing nicotine dependence and regulating nicotine receptor proliferation and destruction. Incorrect formation of the nicotine neurotransmitter receptor protein has a variety of effects.

    For ME/CFS patients, [previous and current smoking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25811400) are associated with a [3X higher risk of severe cognitive and sleep symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28633629), including trouble concentrating and unrefreshing sleep. Additionally, ME/CFS patients also may have [higher levels of nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26983655) in the brain as compared to the general population. High nicotine levels are associated with symptoms, including [abdominal pain, stress, fainting, depression, muscle weakness, muscle twitching, headache, and dizziness](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002510.htm), which may be worsened by smoking.

    # What should I do about this?

    People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency or increased difficulty of quitting smoking. Consider regular checks for lung cancer. Avoid [radiation, toxins such as heavy metal](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all), and eat more [yellow and orange fruits and vegetables](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all).

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Your variant is [5X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524) more common in [ME/CFS patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). It causes the CHRNA3 protein to be malformed, which impacts natural killer cell (NKC) activity. Natural killer cells are a type of white blood cell found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. Many patients with ME/CFS have NKC with lower functional ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with increased illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have NKC that are [half as effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

    [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided.

    Dietary supplements that increase natural killer cell function include:

    - [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) dietary supplements stimulate the immune system by increasing NKC function. 
    - [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), found in food and red wine, may increase NKC activity.

    For ME/CFS patients:
    
    - Due to your higher heart rate, monitor it more closely to stay within the [anabolic threashold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755065) and preserve energy.
    - Monitor for orthostatic intolerance (POTS) due to low blood pressure.

Avoid [radiation, toxins such as heavy metal](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all), and eat more [yellow and orange fruits and vegetables](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all).

    # What is the effect of C645T (C;T)?

    Physical changes associated with this variant include [lower body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and hip circumference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25777141). It also is associated with [higher resting heart rate, lower systolic blood pressure, and higher HDL cholesterol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867305).

    [Caucasians and African Americans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24254305) with this variant have a [1.9X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24337855) increased risk of [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27072204). Asians and  people who have never smoked do not have any increased risk. People with this variant are also [2.7X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25632390) more likely to [smoke higher numbers of cigarettes per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27663783) and have a [2.6X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25632390) increased chance of  severe nicotine addiction. People are also [5.8%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25891233) less likely to follow Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) properly and take [2.0mg](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25891233) less NRT every day.  Among people who smoke more than 30 cigarettes per day, [fatigue and hopelessness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27613883) are  greatly increased. There is increased risk of [schizophrenia and medication side effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054357).

    # What should I do about this?

    People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency or increased difficulty of quitting smoking. 
    
    If you smoke:
    
    - Consider regular checks for lung cancer. 
    - Avoid [radiation, toxins such as heavy metal](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all).
    - Eat more [yellow and orange fruits and vegetables](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all).
    - Watch for signs of schizophrenia and antipsychotic medication side effects.
    - Monitor your mood carefully for depression.

    For ME/CFS patients:
    
    - Due to your higher heart rate, monitor it more closely to stay within the [anabolic threashold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755065) and preserve energy.
    - Monitor for orthostatic intolerance (POTS) due to low blood pressure.

    Consult your physician on [medications](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P32297) that act on variants in CHRNA3, including [Bupropion](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01156), [Cytisine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09028), [Dextromethorphan](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00514), [Ethanol](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00898), [Galantamine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00674), [Levamisole](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00848), [Levomethadyl Acetate](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01227), [Nicotine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00184), [Pentolinium](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01090), and [Varenicline](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01273).

    # What does this mean?

    Your CHRNA3 gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.
