<# Gene_Name CHRNA3 / #>

<# GeneName_full Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3 / #>

# What does the CHRNA3 gene do?

CHRNA3 encodes a neurotransmitter called [acetylcholine](http://www.uniprot.org/citations/8906617) that regulates the creation and destruction of nicotine receptors in the nervous system. It also controls [serotonin](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0022850) channels in the brain. Variants in this gene have been associated with [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290489), [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19836008), [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683) (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), [cocaine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20485328), and [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). This gene is located on chromosome 15.

# What are some common variants of CHRNA3?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect protein function. There are two common variants in CHRNA3: [C78606381T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=12914385) and [C645T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17503/).

    People with this variant have one copy of the [C78606381T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=12914385) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?
    
    The CHRNA3 protein plays a role in developing nicotine dependence and regulating nicotine receptor proliferation and destruction. Incorrect formation of the nicotine neurotransmitter receptor protein has a variety of effects.

    For ME/CFS patients, [previous and current smoking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25811400) are associated with a [3X higher risk of severe cognitive and sleep symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28633629), including trouble concentrating and unrefreshing sleep. Additionally, ME/CFS patients also may have [higher levels of nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26983655) in the brain as compared to the general population. High nicotine levels are associated with symptoms, including [abdominal pain, stress, fainting, depression, muscle weakness, muscle twitching, headache, and dizziness](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002510.htm), which may be worsened by smoking.

    # What should I do about this?

    People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency or increased difficulty of quitting smoking. Consider regular checks for lung cancer. Avoid [radiation, toxins such as heavy metal](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all), and eat more [yellow and orange fruits and vegetables](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all).

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Your variant is [5X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524) more common in [ME/CFS patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). It causes the CHRNA3 protein to be malformed, which impacts natural killer cell (NKC) activity. Natural killer cells are a type of white blood cell found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. Many patients with ME/CFS have NKC with lower functional ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with increased illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have NKC that are [half as effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

    [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided.

    Dietary supplements that increase natural killer cell function include:

    - [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) dietary supplements stimulate the immune system by increasing NKC function. 
    - [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), found in food and red wine, may increase NKC activity.

    # What should I do about this?

    For ME/CFS patients:
    
    - Due to your higher heart rate, monitor it more closely to stay within the [anabolic threashold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755065) and preserve energy.
    - Monitor for orthostatic intolerance (POTS) due to low blood pressure.
  
    People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency or increased difficulty of quitting smoking. Consider regular checks for lung cancer. Avoid [radiation, toxins such as heavy metal](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all), and eat more [yellow and orange fruits and vegetables](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all).

    # What is the effect of C645T (C;T)?

    Physical changes associated with this variant include [lower body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and hip circumference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25777141). It also is associated with [higher resting heart rate, lower systolic blood pressure, and higher HDL cholesterol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867305).

    [Caucasians and African Americans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24254305) with this variant have a [1.9X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24337855) increased risk of [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27072204). Asians and  people who have never smoked do not have any increased risk. People with this variant are also [2.7X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25632390) more likely to [smoke higher numbers of cigarettes per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27663783) and have a [2.6X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25632390) increased chance of  severe nicotine addiction. People are also [5.8%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25891233) less likely to follow Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) properly and take [2.0mg](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25891233) less NRT every day.  Among people who smoke more than 30 cigarettes per day, [fatigue and hopelessness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27613883) are  greatly increased. There is increased risk of [schizophrenia and medication side effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054357).

    # What should I do about this?

    People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency or increased difficulty of quitting smoking. 
    
    If you smoke:
    
    - Consider regular checks for lung cancer. 
    - Avoid [radiation, toxins such as heavy metal](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all).
    - Eat more [yellow and orange fruits and vegetables](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all).
    - Watch for signs of schizophrenia and antipsychotic medication side effects.
    - Monitor your mood carefully for depression.

    For ME/CFS patients:
    
    - Due to your higher heart rate, monitor it more closely to stay within the [anabolic threashold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755065) and preserve energy.
    - Monitor for orthostatic intolerance (POTS) due to low blood pressure.

    Consult your physician on [medications](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P32297) that act on variants in CHRNA3, including [Bupropion](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01156), [Cytisine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09028), [Dextromethorphan](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00514), [Ethanol](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00898), [Galantamine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00674), [Levamisole](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00848), [Levomethadyl Acetate](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01227), [Nicotine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00184), [Pentolinium](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01090), and [Varenicline](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01273).

    # What does this mean?

    Your CHRNA3 gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.
