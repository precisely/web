# What does the CHRNE gene do?

The [CHRNE](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q04844) gene encodes a protein found in the connection between motor neurons and muscle fibers. It is involved in [muscle contractions, response to nicotine, synaptic transmission, and the transport of electrically charged particles (ions) essential for proper cellular function.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q04844#function) Variants in CHRNE are associated with [autoimmune disorders](https://www.omim.org/entry/254200) and [progressive](https://www.omim.org/entry/605809)[muscle](https://www.omim.org/entry/616324)[weakness](https://www.omim.org/entry/608931). Other variants are associated with decreased function of [natural killer cells (NKC)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524), a type of white blood cell that helps the body respond to viral infections. This gene is located on chromosome 17.

# What are some common variants of CHRNE?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect protein function. There are two common variants in CHRNE: [G1074A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/128767/) and [C865T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/18344/).

<# G1074A #>

  <Variant hgvs="NC_000017.10:g.4804902G>A" name="G1074A"> 

    Instead of guanine (G), there is an adenine (A) nucleotide.

  </Variant>

<# C865T #>

  <Variant hgvs="NC_000005.9:g.142709986C>T" name="C865T"> 

    Instead of cytosine (C), there is a thymine (T) nucleotide.

  </Variant>

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have two copies of the [G1074A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/128767/) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Your variant is [4.36X more common in ME/CFS patients.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524)The malformed CHRME receptors may impact the activity of natural killer cells (NKC), a type of white blood cell found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected and tumorous cells. The NKC of many patients with ME/CFS have lower ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with increased illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have NKC that are [half as effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

    # What should I do about this?

    [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided.

    Pharmaceuticals that increase natural killer cell function include:

    - [Antiviral drugs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may improve cellular function. 
    - [Papillomavirus therapies, including topical agents and immunostimulants,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may activate NK cells. 
    - [Cytokine therapies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353), such as [IFN-Î±](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet) in CNKD1, may induce higher levels of NKC activity by [activating white blood cells](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet). 

    Dietary supplements that increase natural killer cell function include:

    - [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) dietary supplements stimulate the immune system by increasing NKC function. 
    - [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), found in food and red wine, may increase NKC activity. 
    - [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), found in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function. 
    - [Bulgarian yogurt fermented with L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus augments NKC activity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686726) 
    - [Zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021581) helps to improve immune system activity and response. 
    - [Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), found in germ, bran, and whole kernel corn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11366552) may activate the immune system and help fight bacterial and fungal infections.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a group of rare disorders that affects the proteins at the neuromuscular junctions and may cause [abnormalities in the CHRME receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16156017). CMS causes easy tiredness, muscle weakness, [scoliosis, and repetitive-compound muscle action.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27779167) Symptoms may worsen during [pregnancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23108489). Other variants associated with myasthenic syndrome include the [AA epsilon1267delG deletion variant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=244116), [1033-1G&gt;C: splice acceptor variant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=410057), [971delT deletion variant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=33387), and [130dupG duplication variant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=244117).
