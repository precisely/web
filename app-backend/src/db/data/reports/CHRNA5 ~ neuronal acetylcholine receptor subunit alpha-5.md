# What does the CHRNA5 gene do?

[CHRNA5](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CHRNA5) creates a protein that controls signals between between [motor neurons and muscle fiber](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0007274)s as well as the body’s response to [nicotine](http://www.uniprot.org/citations/18227835). Variants in CHRNA5 are associated with [anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25826680) and decreased function of [natural killer cells (NKC)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524), a type of white blood cell that helps the body respond to viral infections. This gene is located on chromosome 15.

# What are some common variants of CHRNA5?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect protein function. There are three common variants in CHRNA5: [G1192A (Asp398Asn)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17497/), [A78573551G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=6495306), and [A78581651T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=7180002).

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have two copies of the [G1192A (Asp398Asn)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17497/) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    This variant controls [cognitive function, working memory, and gray matter volume in the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819610). Males with this variant have much faster [information processing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25674902), including [much better behavioral performance, more efficient brain activity, and a larger brain volume.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819610) Females with this variant exhibit much slower information processing, which may worsen ME/CFS cognition issues. [The brain’s control of vision is also impaired](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934182), which may worsen ME/CFS related vision issues. 

    The brain changes caused by this variant is the [strongest genetic risk factor for developing nicotine dependence in African Americans and Caucasians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26239294). It may cause difficulties with smoking cessation and increases the number of [cigarettes smoked per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344179). People are [15% less likely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727484) to be able to quit smoking and respond worse to [nicotine replacement therapy(NRT)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884473). This may be caused due to the variant [increasing the pleasure and mental stimulation experienced after smoking, as well as withdrawal severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25948103). This variant is also associated with an elevated risk and earlier onset of [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27543155), [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26771213) and [newborn lung and breathing problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838476) in the children of smoking mothers.
    
    For ME/CFS patients, [previous and current smoking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25811400) are associated with a [3X higher risk of severe cognitive and sleep symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28633629), including trouble concentrating and unrefreshing sleep. Additionally, ME/CFS patients also may have [higher levels of nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26983655) in the brain as compared to the general population. High nicotine levels are associated with symptoms, including [abdominal pain, stress, fainting, depression, muscle weakness, muscle twitching, headache, and dizziness](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002510.htm), which may be worsened by smoking.

    # What should I do about this?

    People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency or increased difficulty of quitting smoking. Consider regular checks for lung cancer. Avoid [radiation, toxins such as heavy metal](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all), and eat more [yellow and orange fruits and vegetables](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all). Pregnant women should consider [supplemental vitamin C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838476).
  
    Consult your physician on [medications](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P30532#pathology_and_biotech) that act on variants in CHRNA5, including [Ethanol](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00898), [Galantamine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00674), and [nicotine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00184).

    People with this variant have copies of the [G1192A (Asp398Asn)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17497/), [A78573551G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=6495306), and [A78581651T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=7180002) variants. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    There is currently no data on the interaction between these variants.  However, some information exists on the individual variants.

    # What is the effect of G1192A (G;A)?

    This variant controls [cognitive function, working memory, and gray matter volume in the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819610). Males with this variant have faster [information processing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25674902), including [much better behavioral performance, more efficient brain activity, and a larger brain volume.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819610) Females with this variant exhibit slower information processing, which may worsen ME/CFS cognition issues. [The brain’s control of vision is also impaired](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934182), which may worsen ME/CFS related vision issues. 
    
        For ME/CFS patients, [previous and current smoking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25811400) are associated with a [3X higher risk of severe cognitive and sleep symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28633629), including trouble concentrating and unrefreshing sleep. Additionally, ME/CFS patients also may have [higher levels of nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26983655) in the brain as compared to the general population. High nicotine levels are associated with symptoms, including [abdominal pain, stress, fainting, depression, muscle weakness, muscle twitching, headache, and dizziness](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002510.htm), which may be worsened by smoking.

    The brain changes caused by this variant is the [strongest genetic risk factor for developing nicotine dependence in African Americans and Caucasians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26239294). It may cause difficulties with smoking cessation and increases the number of [cigarettes smoked per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344179). People are [15% less likely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727484) to be able to quit smoking and respond worse to [nicotine replacement therapy(NRT)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884473). This may be caused due to the variant [increasing the pleasure and mental stimulation experienced after smoking, as well as withdrawal severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25948103). This variant is also associated with a greater risk for [lung cancer and COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344179).

    # What is the effect of A78573551G?

    This variant acts in the part of the [brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26220977) that controls motor function, problem solving, language, judgement, impulse control, sexual behavior, and memory formation and processing. This may cause ME/CFS related cognition issues. This variant causes [greater gene expression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21229299), and is associated with increased [risk of ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25233467)[lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21229299) and [nicotine addiction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28132300), especially in [Caucasians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26270548).

    # What is the effect of A78581651T?

    Your variant is [2X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524) more common in [ME/CFS patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). It causes the CHRNA5 protein to be malformed, which impacts natural killer cell (NKC) activity. Natural killer cells are a type of white blood cell found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. Many patients with ME/CFS have NKC with lower functional ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with increased illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have NKC that are [half as effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

    # What should I do about this?

    People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency or increased difficulty of quitting smoking. Consider regular checks for lung cancer. Avoid [radiation, toxins such as heavy metal](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all), and eat more [yellow and orange fruits and vegetables](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all).

    [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided.

    Pharmaceuticals that increase natural killer cell function include:

    - [Antiviral drugs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may improve cellular function. 
    - [Papillomavirus therapies, including topical agents and immunostimulants,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may activate NK cells. 
    - [Cytokine therapies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353), such as [IFN-α](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet) in CNKD1, may induce higher levels of NKC activity by [activating white blood cells](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet). 

    Dietary supplements that increase natural killer cell function include:

    - [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) dietary supplements stimulate the immune system by increasing NKC function. 
    - [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), found in food and red wine, may increase NKC activity. 
    - [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), found in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function. 
    - [Bulgarian yogurt fermented with L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus augments NKC activity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686726) 
    - [Zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021581) helps to improve immune system activity and response.  
    - [Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), found in germ, bran, and whole kernel corn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11366552) may activate the immune system and help fight bacterial and fungal infections.
