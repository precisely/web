# What does the CHRNB4 gene do?

The [CHRNB4](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P30926) gene creates a protein that is part of [nicotine receptor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1143). It also affects muscle contraction and the function of neurons. Variants in CHRNB4 have been linked to an increased risk of [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385738?dopt=Abstract) and [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19443489). For ME/CFS patients, variants are associated with [severe cognitive and sleep symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28633629) and decreased function of [natural killer cells (NKC)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524), a type of white blood cell that helps the body respond to viral infections. This gene is located on chromosome 15.

# What are some common variants of CHRNB4?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect protein function. There are three common variants in CHRNB4: [C78631645T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=17487223), [G78635922T](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.4137/III.S25147), and [A78638168G](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.4137/III.S25147).

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    CHRN genes play a large role in the risk for nicotine dependence, smoking, and lung cancer. This CHRNB4 variant is associated:

    - [Higher risk of habitual smoking in Caucasians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519524?dopt=Abstract) 
    - [1.45X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19259974?dopt=Abstract) higher risk for a risk of heavy smoking 
    - [1.33 higher risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19259974?dopt=Abstract) of [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19443489?dopt=Abstract) 
    - Increased susceptibility to [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385738?dopt=Abstract). 

    For ME/CFS patients, [previous and current smoking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25811400) are associated with a [3X higher risk of severe cognitive and sleep symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28633629), including trouble concentrating and unrefreshing sleep. Additionally, ME/CFS patients also may have [higher levels of nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26983655) in the brain as compared to the general population. High nicotine levels are associated with symptoms, including [abdominal pain, stress, fainting, depression, muscle weakness, muscle twitching, headache, and dizziness](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002510.htm), which may be worsened by smoking.

    # What should I do about this?

    People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency or increased difficulty of quitting smoking. Consider regular checks for lung cancer. Avoid [radiation, toxins such as heavy metal](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all), and eat more [yellow and orange fruits and vegetables](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all).

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Your variant is [1.2X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524) more common in ME/CFS patients. The malformed CHRNB4 protein may impact the activity of natural killer cells (NKC), a type of white blood cell found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected and tumorous cells. The NKC of many patients with ME/CFS have lower ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with increased illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have NKC that are [half as effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

    # What should I do about this?

    [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided.

    CHRN genes play a large role in the risk for nicotine dependence, smoking, and lung cancer. This homozygous CHRNB4 variant is associated with:

    - A [much higher risk of habitual smoking in Caucasians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519524?dopt=Abstract) 
    - [1.64X higher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19259974?dopt=Abstract) risk of heavy smoking 
    - [1.33X higher risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19259974?dopt=Abstract) of [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19443489?dopt=Abstract) 
    - 1.28X greater risk of [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385738?dopt=Abstract). 

    For ME/CFS patients, [previous and current smoking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25811400) are associated with [3X higher risk of severe severe cognitive and sleep symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28633629), including trouble concentrating and unrefreshing sleep. Additionally, ME/CFS patients also may have [higher levels of nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26983655) in the brain as compared to the general population. High nicotine levels are associated with symptoms such as [abdominal pain, stress, fainting, depression, muscle weakness, muscle twitching, headache, and dizziness](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002510.htm), and smoking may lead to a worsening of these symptoms.

    Your variant is [1.2X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524) more common in ME/CFS patients. The malformed CHRNB4 protein may impact the activity of natural killer cells (NKC), a type of white blood cell found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected and tumorous cells. The NKC of many patients with ME/CFS have lower ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with increased illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have NKC that are [half as effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

    # What should I do about this?

    [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided.

    Pharmaceuticals that increase natural killer cell function include:

    - [Antiviral drugs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may improve cellular function. 
    - [Papillomavirus therapies, including topical agents and immunostimulants,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may activate NK cells. 
    - [Cytokine therapies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353), such as [IFN-α](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet) in CNKD1, may induce higher levels of NKC activity by [activating white blood cells](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet). 

    Dietary supplements that increase natural killer cell function include:

    - [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) dietary supplements stimulate the immune system by increasing NKC function. 
    - [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), found in food and red wine, may increase NKC activity. 
    - [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), found in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function. 
    - [Bulgarian yogurt fermented with L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus augments NKC activity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686726) 
    - [Zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021581) helps to improve immune system activity and response.  
    - [Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), found in germ, bran, and whole kernel corn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11366552) may activate the immune system and help fight bacterial and fungal infections. 
    - [Arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25541298)) increases activation and stimulates cell killing activity.

    # What is the effect of G78635922T (T;T)?

    Your variant is [1.2X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524) more common in ME/CFS patients. The malformed CHRNB4 protein may impact the activity of natural killer cells (NKC), a type of white blood cell found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected and tumorous cells. The NKC of many patients with ME/CFS have lower ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with increased illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have NKC that are [half as effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

    # What should I do about this?

    [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided.

    Pharmaceuticals that increase natural killer cell function include:

    - [Antiviral drugs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may improve cellular function. 
    - [Papillomavirus therapies, including topical agents and immunostimulants,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may activate NK cells. 
    - [Cytokine therapies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353), such as [IFN-α](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet) in CNKD1, may induce higher levels of NKC activity by [activating white blood cells](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet). 

    Dietary supplements that increase natural killer cell function include:

    - [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) dietary supplements stimulate the immune system by increasing NKC function. 
    - [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), found in food and red wine, may increase NKC activity. 
    - [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), found in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function. 
    - [Bulgarian yogurt fermented with L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus augments NKC activity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686726) 
    - [Zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021581) helps to improve immune system activity and response.  
    - [Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), found in germ, bran, and whole kernel corn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11366552) may activate the immune system and help fight bacterial and fungal infections.

    People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency or increased difficulty of quitting smoking. Consider regular checks for lung cancer. Avoid [radiation, toxins such as heavy metal](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all), and eat more [yellow and orange fruits and vegetables](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all).
