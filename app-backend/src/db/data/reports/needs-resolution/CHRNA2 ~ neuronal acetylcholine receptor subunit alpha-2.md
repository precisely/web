# What does the CHRNA2 gene do?

[CHRNA2](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15822) creates a protein that is part of a nicotine receptor in the brain. This receptor binds to [acetylcholine](https://www.britannica.com/science/acetylcholine), the chief neurotransmitter controlling muscle contraction, blood vessel dilation, and heart rate. After it binds to acetylcholine, channels in cells are opened to transport [electrically charged particles (ions) essential for cellular function.](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15822) Variants in CHRNA2 are linked to [epilepsy](http://www.uniprot.org/diseases/DI-00821), [seizures](https://www.omim.org/entry/601764), [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467848), and [ME](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524)[/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253422). This gene is located on chromosome 8.

# What are some common variants of CHRNA2?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect protein function. There are five common variants in CHRNA2: [C65T (p.Thr22Ile)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/128740/), [A27468610G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2741343), [A373G (p.Thr125Ala)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/128739/), [T836A (p.Ile279Asn)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17504/), and[889A>T (p.Ile297Phe)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/522582/).
