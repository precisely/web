# What does the CRHR1 gene do?

[CRHR1](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P34998) encodes a protein that binds to a neurotransmitter for hormones. These hormones are necessary for normal embryonic development and act in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) pathway, controlling [stress, reproduction, immune response, and obesity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1394). CRHR1 also helps activate enzymes to help transfer the effects of hormones into cells and activate proteins. Variants in CRHR1 have been linked with [depression](http://www.disgenet.org/web/DisGeNET/menu/browser/tab8a?0&pview=default&pf=http://www.disgenet.org/web/DisGeNET%3Fdata/genes::1394::de&pf=/data/sources::ALL::de), [Parkinson’s](https://www.targetvalidation.org/target/ENSG00000263715/associations?view=t:table), and [ME](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26063326)/[CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18986552).  This gene is located on chromosome 17.

# What are some common variants of CRHR1?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect protein function. There are two common variants in CRHR1: [A45815234G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=242940) and [G45825631A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1396862).

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have one copy of the [A45815234G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=242940) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Your variant may cause a change in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) pathway and is mildly associated with [increased severity of ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18986552).

    The disruption of the HPA axis [leads to improper immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15467349) response and is linked to ME/CFS. Improper stress response mediated by CRHR1 may cause too many white blood cells to be created in response to attack. This [hyper-immune](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15949897) state leads the brain to organize a sickness response that may be overly sensitive in response to any stressor. Patients may then feel ill without sufficient external cause.

    [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549189) has also been associated with lower levels of HPA activity caused by [immune system abnormalities, inflammation, and oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27766535). This may cause [mild hypocortisolism (or a lack of cortisol), improper cortisol cycles, and poor HPA response](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893), correlating with increased disability and worse response to standard treatment.

    Hypocortisolism also causes decreases the ability of the body to respond to stress and heightens negative side-effects. The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system, including the gene CRHR1, mediates both the initial and sustained responses to stress, including [blood pressure, heart function, immune response, and metabolism](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease). Impairment due to hypocortisolism may lead to or perpetuate many ME/CFS symptoms, including [pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17596739), [fatigue, muscle weakness, and POTS](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease).

    # What should I do about this?

    [Oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant capacity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549189) in ME/CFS patients caused by [HPA disruption](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549189) may be mitigated through environmental and dietary changes.
    - Consider a diet higher in [antioxidants](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm), such as vitamins C and E, selenium, and beta-carotene
    - Consider eating [red, blue, and purple berries such as blueberries and cranberries; orange and dark, leafy green vegetables such as pumpkin and spinach; tomato; red grapes; and peanuts](https://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/what-are-phytochemicals)
    - [Robuvit](https://www.robuvit.com/home/)® (oak wood extract) is effective in reducing [oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29164838) and [fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29719945), while improving cognition, sleep, and memory. Consider taking [300mg/day](https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/sports-med-physical-fitness/article.php?cod=R40Y2018N05A0678)
    - Avoid [ionizing radiation, smoking, metals, and high oxygen atmospheres](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet#q1)

    Patients should check their cortisol levels. Cortisol levels may be reduced due to [inactivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893), [depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893), or [early-life stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893). 
    - If too low, consider [psychotropic medication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893) and cognitive behavioral therapy ([CBT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893)). Consult your physician. 
    - If elevated consider [magnesium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18500945), [omega-3 fish oil]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12909818), [massage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16162447), [Withania somnifera (ashwagandha) root extract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23439798), and [high-dose vitamin C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11862365). Consult your physician. 

    CRHR1 medication includes [Corticorelin ovine triflutate](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09067), but [steroid replacement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893) is not recommended.

    The disruption of the HPA axis [leads to improper immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15467349) response and is linked to ME/CFS. Improper stress response mediated by CRHR1 may cause too many white blood cells to be created in response to attack. This [hyper-immune](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15949897) state leads the brain to organize a sickness response that may be overly sensitive in response to any stressor. Patients may then feel ill without sufficient external cause.

    [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549189) has also been associated with lower levels of HPA activity caused by [immune system abnormalities, inflammation, and oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27766535). This may cause [mild hypocortisolism (or a lack of cortisol), improper cortisol cycles, and poor HPA response](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893), correlating with increased disability and worse response to standard treatment.

    Hypocortisolism also causes decreases the ability of the body to respond to stress and heightens negative side-effects. The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system, including the gene CRHR1, mediates both the initial and sustained responses to stress, including [blood pressure, heart function, immune response, and metabolism](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease). Impairment due to hypocortisolism may lead to or perpetuate many ME/CFS symptoms, including [pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17596739), [fatigue, muscle weakness, and POTS](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease).

    # What should I do about this?

    [Oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant capacity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549189) in ME/CFS patients caused by [HPA disruption](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549189) may be mitigated through environmental and dietary changes.
    - Consider a diet higher in [antioxidants](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm), such as vitamins C and E, selenium, and beta-carotene
    - Consider eating [red, blue, and purple berries such as blueberries and cranberries; orange and dark, leafy green vegetables such as pumpkin and spinach; tomato; red grapes; and peanuts](https://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/what-are-phytochemicals)
    - [Robuvit](https://www.robuvit.com/home/)® (oak wood extract) is effective in reducing [oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29164838) and [fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29719945), while improving cognition, sleep, and memory. Consider taking [300mg/day](https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/sports-med-physical-fitness/article.php?cod=R40Y2018N05A0678)
    - Avoid [ionizing radiation, smoking, metals, and high oxygen atmospheres](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet#q1)

    Patients should check their cortisol levels. Cortisol levels may be reduced due to [inactivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893), [depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893), or [early-life stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893). 
    - If too low, consider [psychotropic medication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893) and cognitive behavioral therapy ([CBT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893)). Consult your physician. 
    - If elevated consider [magnesium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18500945), [omega-3 fish oil]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12909818), [massage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16162447), [Withania somnifera (ashwagandha) root extract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23439798), and [high-dose vitamin C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11862365). Consult your physician. 

    CRHR1 medication includes [Corticorelin ovine triflutate](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09067), but [steroid replacement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893) is not recommended.
