# What does the GRIK2 gene do?

GRIK2 encodes the receptor in the brain for the neurotransmitter [glutamate](https://neurotransporter.org/glutamate.html). When [L-glutamate](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13002) binds to these receptors, it opens electrical channels to pass messages in the brain. These receptors may be involved in [learning, memory, neuroplasticity, and eyesight](http://www.uniprot.org/diseases/DI-01245). Variants may be related to [mental retardation](http://www.uniprot.org/diseases/DI-01245), [cognitive disability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2898), [OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4836736/), [suicidal thoughts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21912186), and [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21912186). This gene is located on chromosome 6.

# What are some common variants of GRIK2?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect mitochondrial enzyme function. There is one common variant in GRIK2: [A101518578G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2247215).

  <Variant hgvs="NC_000006.11:g.101966454A>G" name="A101518578G"> 

    Instead of adenine (A), there is a guanine (G) nucleotide.

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have one copy of the [A101518578G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2247215) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Your variant is [2X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21912186) more common in ME/CFS patients compared to the [general population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21912186). It may also be linked with another [cytosine (C) variant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2247218) in GRIK2, but the exact relationship is undetermined. 

    Your G variant causes a [10-fold decrease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21912186) in GRIK2 expression and may lead to improper glutamate receptor creation. GRIK2 receptors control the ability of synapses to activate or deactivate and help to transmit light from the retina to the brain. The 10 fold decrease in activity may lead to cognitive issues including learning and memory as well as eyesight problems. Your variant has also been linked to increased [OCD severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4836736/) and [suicidal thoughts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21912186).

    The reduced formation and action of glutamate receptors due to your variant may also cause [elevated levels of glutamate outside of cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5314655/). Nerve cells are then [damaged or killed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10807/) due to excessive stimulation. For ME/CFS patients, sustained exposure to excess [extracellular glutamate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5314655/) causes [sickness behavior, neurotoxicity, stress, and peripheral nervous sensitivity, including weakness, numbness and pain.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5314655/)

    # What should I do about this?

    Consider measuring your extracellular glutamate levels. If elevated:
    - Medications may include: [Glutamic Acid](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00142),[Ketamine, Riluzole, Lamotrigine, and Memantine](http://web.stanford.edu/group/hopes/cgi-bin/hopes_test/glossary/anti-glutamate/). 
    - Dietary supplements may include: [Omega-3 PUFAs, CoQ10, N-acetylcysteine, vitamin B12, curcumin, zinc, magnesium, L-Taurine, and L-carnitine.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5314655/) 

    Lifestyle changes may include the following.
    - Be aware of and monitor your mood for signs of depression.  
    - If you experience problems with thinking and memory, consider learning new skills and being active to increase your [“cognitive reserve.”](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/cognitive-health-and-older-adults) 
    - Consider [formal cognitive training](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/cognitive-health-and-older-adults) such as memory training, reasoning training, or processing–speed training.
