<# <Gene_Name GRIK3 /> #>

<# <GeneName_full Glutamate receptor ionotropic, kainate 3 /> #>

# What does the GRIK3 gene do?

The GRIK3 gene creates a protein that helps form receptors for the neurotransmitter [glutamate](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/educational-resources/brain-basics/brain-basics.shtml). It increases the chance neurons will fire and enhances the electrical flow among brain cells, but elevated levels of glutamate are toxic to neurons. Problems creating or absorbing glutamate are linked to ME/CFS, [major](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16958029) [depressive disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19221446/), [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19921975/), [and memory problems](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/educational-resources/brain-basics/brain-basics.shtml). This gene is located on chromosome 1.

# What are some common variants of GRIK3?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect protein function. There are two common variants in GRIK3: [T928G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=6691840)[(Ser310Ala)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11986986) and [C36983994T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=3913434).

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have one copy of the [T928G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=6691840)[(Ser310Ala)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11986986) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Having one copy of this variant has been linked [recurrent major depressive disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16958029) and was found to increase the risk of [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19921975/) by [30%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25054019?dopt=Abstract).

    # What should I do about this?

    Patients should be aware of their greater risk of depression, and consult with their physician regarding medication, including [Glutamic Acid](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00142). Treatments include psychotherapy, light therapy (being in bright sunlight for 20-30 minutes), art therapy, and animal therapy.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    This variant was found was found in [90.5% of ME/CFS patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835969), compared with 21.1% of healthy patients. Changes to the glutamate receptor caused by this variant may impair [electrical flow among brain cells and reduce glutamate binding ability.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/educational-resources/brain-basics/brain-basics.shtml) Elevated levels of glutamate outside of cells ([extracellular glutamate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5314655/)) causes [excitotoxicity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10807/), a process when nerve cells are damaged or killed by excessive stimulation. For ME/CFS patients, sustained exposure to excess [extracellular glutamate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5314655/) causes [sickness behavior, neurotoxicity, stress, and peripheral nervous sensitivity, including weakness, numbness and pain.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5314655/) ME/CFS is also linked to an incorrect ratio of[glutamate to GABA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5314655/). Excess glutamate and low GABA may cause increased pain, anxiety, and an inability to focus. 

    # What should I do about this?

    For elevated glutamate levels:

    - Medications may include: [Glutamic Acid](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00142), [Ketamine, Riluzole, Lamotrigine, and Memantine](http://web.stanford.edu/group/hopes/cgi-bin/hopes_test/glossary/anti-glutamate/). 
    - Dietary supplements may include: [Omega-3 PUFAs, CoQ10, N-acetylcysteine, vitamin B12, curcumin, zinc, magnesium, L-Taurine, and L-carnitine.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5314655/) 

    For low GABA levels:

    - Medications may include: benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam and Xanax, and sleep medications, including Ambien and Lunesta. 
    - Dietary supplements may include: 5-HTP (a synthetic form of tryptophan), glutamine (found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy, and wheat), and Taurine (found in meat and seafood).  

    Lifestyle changes to improve anxiety, stress, and pain include [meditation, tai-chi, yoga, and stretching](https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html#cat_78).
